# Intro

Roil is an HTTP server written in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) which:

* Track dependency via `Referer` HTTP header
* Watch files to see if they change
* Notify browsers to refresh if change happens

Good for rapid prototyping and JavaScript unit testing.

## Installation

[Install Node and npm first](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation).

Then install Roil with npm:

    $ npm install roil -g

## Usage

In your working directory:

    $ ls
    bar.css  foo.html
    $ roil -b firefox & # Assume you've got firefox in your $PATH

Then in the opened page, enter `foo.html` and click the open button.
Try to edit `foo.html` and see your browser automatically refresh
every time you save it.

`roil -h` would help you.
